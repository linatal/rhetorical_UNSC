		<segment id="10" parent="65" relname="antithesis">In that regard, we view as unacceptable attempts to dictate to African Governments settlement recipes without their consent or request.</segment>
		<segment id="11" parent="62" relname="list">We welcome the increased activity by Africans themselves with regard to emergency response,</segment>
		<segment id="12" parent="62" relname="list">as well as the growing participation by African women in peacekeeping and peacebuilding efforts.</segment>

		<segment id="23" parent="76" relname="span">The participation ofwomen in such efforts has much positive potential.</segment>
		<segment id="24" parent="23" relname="elaboration">We must also note the efforts of specialized subregional and regional organizations in that regard.</segment>

		<segment id="30" parent="82" relname="span">No less pressing is the need to ensure the effectiveness of efforts</segment>
		<segment id="31" parent="30" relname="e-elaboration">to deal with violence against women during armed conflicts in Africa.</segment>
		<segment id="32" parent="84" relname="conjunction">There is also a need to ensure that the inclusion of gender aspects in our work on the ground does not become an end in itself</segment>

		<segment id="34" parent="85" relname="reason-S">We should aim at achieving real results.</segment>

		<segment id="42" parent="97" relname="span">The international community and the United Nations must provide them assistance in that regard.</segment>
		<segment id="43" parent="98" relname="conjunction">One of the main objectives of peacekeeping and peacebuilding efforts should be the restoration of normal life</segment>
		<segment id="44" parent="98" relname="conjunction">and the elimination of the consequences of conflicts,</segment>
		<segment id="45" parent="98" relname="conjunction">as well as safeguarding the security of all strata and groups of the population.</segment>
		<segment id="46" parent="47" relname="attribution">As we have noted earlier,</segment>
